# Here we are

...I think I got conned...
  Know that thinking?
  
Won’t let this pull me down.
People use Love as a weapon,
To afraid to actually feel something.
Let me know when you are down to feel
...Sounds
Okay.
I'll get the ring.

$BlaBla$ 

Where am I going now? 
Loss time? She still helped me to realize
a few things about what I want in a relationship.
Will make the next part of the story relevant.

Try not to fall asleep.
Life is a mirage of beautiful clips.
Take it all in.
Make it go deep.
Invent, make heaps.

1rst Stage down.

--------------
Time to go down town to reel,
-move ahead.
There is no one but you who can
Make your life what you want it to be.
Send directions, let people meet you,
Don't lead them to rob you.

Love is always here.
Feel it right in.
I know you care.
And then the train foes?
Goes?
Time for a common ground.
Make friends, not threats.

There
Abundance is always, here.
Remember to breath in.
What do you feel?

"Nee flat out."

What to be with that lover, friend, believer of tha greater existence
Remember them.
And Dance.
No hour. No place to be sour.
Sweet and bitter.
You love her.

Life

Beyond there is that sound.
Love above reason.
Call in' there is a bond.
Try out, make out, split out.
Why now? Why not?

There is no one around.
I just stick to known ground.
Will you jump off track?
Knowing she is fine.
Takes all the sorrow away.
And when she is not, 
Send that love you know you can.

Right here.
Call me Back.

A-Clip-Shoot.
